# EMBOSS Offline Analysis
Run EMBOSS functions offline through the terminal

Object files were generated by compiling the mirror at https://github.com/kimrutherford/EMBOSS, it can be done with:
```
git clone https://github.com/kimrutherford/EMBOSS
cd EMBOSS
./configure
make
```

Documentation for using the functions can be found here: https://galaxy-iuc.github.io/emboss-5.0-docs/dotmatcher.html

Example usage:
```
./dotmatcher sarscov2_DNA.txt sarscov_DNA.txt -windowsize=5 -threshold=20 -goutfile="dotmatch_window5"
./dottup sarscov2_DNA.txt sarscov_DNA.txt

```
Graph type and word size will be prompted as input. One could easily write a C/Python script to automate this
